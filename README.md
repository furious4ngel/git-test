This is t4rantino's first git project!

I am using The Odin Project curriculum to teach myself web development. So far, its lessons have taught me about what developers do, what tools they use, and more, and I am excited to see where TOP takes me.

In this project, I learned how to create a repository on GitHub, copy it to my computer, add, edit, and save files with Git, and upload my project to GitHub. Soon, I will know the ins and outs of Git and GitHub!
